# Blink Example

This is a very basic example that blinks the LED on the esp32MX-E board, using a FreeRTOS task.

It uses ESP-IDF, the official development framework for the ESP32 chip from Espressif(manufacturers of theee ESP32). For details, see [github.com/espressif/esp-idf](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf)

See the [README.md](../README.md) file in the upper level 'examples/idf' directory for more information about examples.
