# Examples using ESP-IDF
This folder contains examples using ESP-IDF, the official development framework for the ESP32 chip from Espressif(manufacturers of the ESP32). For details, see [github.com/espressif/esp-idf](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf)

They have been built using **v4.0**, with Long Term Support by Espressif. For details on installing the development environment, see this page:  
https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v4.0/get-started/index.html  
It might also work with the latest stable realease. We have however currently only tested it with v4.0:  
https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/get-started/

As mentioned in the "Get ESP-IDF" section, the best way to get it is to use the GIT command:  
`git clone -b v4.0 --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git`
